The aim for this project was to create a web interface that allowed different agencies to upload data to a centralized database and also be able to query the database for any type traffic data anywhere in the valley.

The app is designed to work with mongoDB in order to store and query the data  so while running the app without the database will not allow for the database query requests to complete successfully. 

The login and authorization process is still not yet complete but is somewhat responsive to user input.
