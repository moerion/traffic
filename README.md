Please keep in mind that this was a very rushed project and in the small amount of time I had to work on it, I also had to learn how do it as I had no previous experience with any of this material. NodeJS, Javascript, mongoDB were all brand new to me. As I rushed to get things up and running to meet deadlines, I rarely commented anything so it might be hard to read and understand. 

The aim for this project was to create a web interface that allowed different agencies to upload data to a centralized database and also be able to query the database for any type traffic data anywhere in the valley.

The app is designed to work with mongoDB in order to store and query the data  so while running the app without the database will not allow for the database query requests to complete successfully. 

The login and authorization process is still not yet complete but is somewhat responsive to user input.

A an older version of the app without a database can be seen live at http://trc.unlv.edu:3000/
